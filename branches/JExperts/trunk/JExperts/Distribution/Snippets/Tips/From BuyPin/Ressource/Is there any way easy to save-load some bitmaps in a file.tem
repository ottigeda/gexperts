Question : 
Is there any way easy to save/load some bitmaps in a file? 

Answer : 
Create a resource file with all your bitmaps using Image Editor. 
Link it into your source file using the {$r file.res} notation. 
Load them into a TBitmap using the LoadFromResourceName method like so: 

MyBitmap.LoadFromResourceName(HINSTANCE, 'MYRESBITMAP1');
