Question : 
How can I hide my application from the task manager ? 

Answer : 

DEFINE IT: 

function RegisterServiceProcess(dwProcessID: DWORD; dwType: DWORD) : DWORD; 
stdcall; external 'KERNEL32.DLL'; 

THEN... 

RegisterServiceProcess(GetCurrentProcessId(), 1); 

Yup, you guessed it... Changing the 0 to 1 will make it magically re-appear.
