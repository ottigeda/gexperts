These files are part of the official GExperts release.
Usually they will already have been installed by
the GExperts installer.
They are provided, because an official GExperts installer
might not yet exist. In that case, copy them
together with all the other files to your GExperts installation
directory. e.g.:
c:\program files\GExperts for Rad Studio XE5
